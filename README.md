```
I'm not going out tonight
So don't bother calling my phone
'Cause I'm not pickin' up
tonight
Not tonight
Baby, you're my remedy
When you're lyin' next to me
Baby, you're a melody
I wish I wrote
I need you like I need home
To kick my feet up
and rest my soul
I'm here knocking at your door
Just give me the key
and let my heart go dum-dee-dum
And if my home's
where my heart is
Leaving you makes me homesick
I need you like I need home
To kick up my feet
and let my heart go dum-dee-dum
Dum-dee-dum, dum-dee-dum
And let my heart go dum-dee-dum
Dum-dee-dum, dum-dee-dum
And let my heart go dum-dee-dum
And if my home's
wherе my heart is
Leaving you makes mе homesick
I need you like I need home
To kick up my feet
and let my heart go dum-dee-dum
I'm not going out tonight
So don't bother calling my phone
'Cause I'm not pickin' up
tonight
Leave me a message at the tone
It's a no
No, I'm with you
Yeah, I'm home
But I'm not alone,
no I'm not alone
I'm with you
Baby, you're my remedy
When you're lyin' next to me
Baby, you're a melody
I wish I wrote
I need you like I need home
To kick my feet up
and rest my soul
I'm here knocking at your door
Just give me the key
and let my heart go dum-dee-dum
Dum-dee-dum, dum-dee-dum
And let my heart go dum-dee-dum
Dum-dee-dum, dum-dee-dum
And let my heart go dum-dee-dum
And if my home's
where my heart is
Leaving you makes me homesick
I need you like I need home
To kick up my feet
and let my heart go dum-dee-dum
